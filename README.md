## Project Configuration

### Development Configuration

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. After installing dependencies, start the development server by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   This command will start the development server, and you can view your React app in the browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Configuration

1. Before deploying your React app to production, ensure that you have optimized your application for production.
2. Build your React app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

   This command will create a production-ready build of your React app in the `build` directory.

3. Once the build process is complete, you can deploy your React app to a hosting provider of your choice.
